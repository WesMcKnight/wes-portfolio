Welcome to my portfolio page!

As of me writing this, the purpose of this repository is more-or-less open ended. Essentially, I want to track my overall progress as a developer, and have an external means of displaying my work.

If you are following along, I encourage you to hold yourself accountable as well and dedicate yourself to making small, consistent progress daily, as that is also my goal with this repo.
